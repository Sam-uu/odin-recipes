                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large casserole warm the olive oil over medium heat and add the meat, the onion and the spices. Leave for 5 to 10 minutes to lightly brown the meat and sweat the onions. Stir occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the rest of the ingredients in the casserole except the lentils, the cornflour, the coriander and the lemon wedges.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 litre of water, cover with a lid and reduce the heat to low.</li>
                    <li>Leave to simmer for 60 minutes or until the meat is just about to be cooked.</li>
                    <li>Add the lentils in the casserole and cover with a lid for 20 minutes. This will allow the lentils to cook and and the meat to finish cooking.</li>
                    <li>When the chickpeas, the meat and the lentils are cooked, in a small bowl mix the cornflour with 3 tablespoons of water and stir until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Pour the cornflour mixture in the casserole and stir.</li>
                    <li>Simmer for 5 minutes until the harira thickens. Adding cornflour allows to thicken the harira in order to give it a velvety texture.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the chopped coriander in the casserole and stir. Serve hot with lemon wedges.</li>
                </ol>
