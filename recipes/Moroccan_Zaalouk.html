                    Zaalouk is one of the most basic salads of Moroccan cuisine and there are a million ways of preparing it all across Morocco.
                    From region to region or just from a family to another, the recipe often differs.

                    The recipe I am sharing with you today is my mum’s, I find it very easy, quick and it requires just a few ingredients.

                    If you are looking for a velvety aubergine salad and a gentle boost of Moroccan aromas than you should definitely try it.
                    Zaalouk is great on its own, as a dip, but you can also have it as a side dish or a spread in a super tasty sandwich. Your choice.

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Combine the ingredients with water in a large deep skillet or pot.
                        Cover and simmer over medium to medium-high heat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>With a spoon or potato masher, crush and blend tomatoes and eggplant.</li>
                    <li>Add lemon wedge to the pot, if using. Continue simmering mixture, uncovered, for 10 minutes.
                        The lemon will give a tangy nuance but is not necessary.</li>
                    <li>The zaalouk is ready when liquids are reduced and mixture can be stirred into a heap in the center of the pan.</li>
                    <li>Drizzle olive oil or chile oil if you like spicy food. Serve with sliced crusty bread.</li>
                </ol>
